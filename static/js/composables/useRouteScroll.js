/**
 * useRouteScroll.js
 * Owns the "where do we scroll when a route resolves" decision, plus scroll-
 * position memory for back/forward navigation. Instantiated once, in App.js, and
 * its scrollForRoute() is called from onRouteResolve (the data-ready moment for
 * the incoming view).
 *
 * Three outcomes, in priority order:
 *   1. Back/forward (pop) to a route we have a saved position for -> RESTORE it,
 *      so returning to a long feed lands where the reader left off.
 *   2. A #hash in the URL -> smooth-scroll to that element (deep-link anchors,
 *      cross-page anchor links).
 *   3. Otherwise -> scroll to the TOP (articles, lists, pager pages).
 *
 * Mechanics dictated by the architecture:
 *   - The scroller is .v-application, not window (Fixed-Viewport, §8), so the
 *     browser's native anchor jump and its history scroll-restoration are inert.
 *     We manage the container ourselves and set history.scrollRestoration =
 *     'manual' so the browser doesn't fight us with a window-scroll restore.
 *   - App.js wraps the router-view in <transition mode="out-in">, so the incoming
 *     content is NOT in the DOM at resolve time. Both the hash scroll and the
 *     position restore therefore poll across a bounded number of animation frames
 *     until the target element (hash) or the needed content height (restore)
 *     exists. This also covers a direct deep link, where there is no enter
 *     transition at all. Standard h2/h3 ids come from Hugo's autoHeadingID, so
 *     they exist as soon as the content renders.
 *   - Pop vs push is detected with a one-shot flag set by a popstate listener
 *     (capture phase, so it is set before the navigation it triggers resolves).
 *     Positions are captured in a router.beforeEach for the OUTGOING route, while
 *     its content + scroll are still on screen.
 *
 * In-page TOC clicks do NOT come through here: useTableOfContents scrolls and
 * updates the hash via history.replaceState WITHOUT a route change, so no route
 * resolves and this decision never runs for them.
