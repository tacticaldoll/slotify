/**
 * useSlotBridge.js — the relayer between Vue/Vuetify state and slots.
 *
 * Slotify Slots are authored from the site root as plain HTML + <script>, with no
 * Vue/Vuetify access. For a slot to react to ambient app state (theme/personality,
 * UI language, route) it would otherwise have to reach into framework internals —
 * e.g. read Vuetify's `v-theme--dark` class — coupling every override to an
 * implementation detail. This composable watches the reactive sources once and
 * re-broadcasts each change as a stable, semantic `slotify:*` window event, so
 * slots depend on those events rather than the framework internals.
 *
 * The event family (change notifications; a slot reads its initial state from the
 * `ctx` it receives — `ctx.theme`, `ctx.route`, `ctx.t`):
 *   - `slotify:theme`  detail = { name, personality, mode }   // mode = 'light'|'dark'
 *   - `slotify:locale` detail = { locale }
 *   - `slotify:route`  detail = { path, name }                // for global slots that don't remount
 *
 * Emit sites live only here (the one place that broadcasts ambient state) —
 * never scattered across setters. Call this from a synchronous setup() before
 * any await so its watches register against the live instance; App.js does so.

  // restored localStorage value — broadcasts, without coupling to a specific setter.

  // this is primarily for global slots (header/footer/head) that persist across
  // navigation and need SPA pageview-style hooks.
